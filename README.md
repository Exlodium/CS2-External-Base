# CS2-External-Base
A simple free to use CS2 external cheat base

# About
This is my first public project, I've decided to share a stripped down version of my external cheat as a learning example for other people interested in making CS2 cheats. \
From my limited play testing the cheat does not seem to get you banned, however I can not garuantee safety ( use at your own risk ). \
I've based this cheat on the principle of **READ ONLY** in an attempt to stay clear of bans

# How to use
Compile as Release or Debug. Either configuration will provide you with a compiled .exe file.
> [!IMPORTANT]
> Only the Debug build will open a cmd window\
> Open menu with "INS" / "INSERT", unload with "DEL" / "DELETE"
